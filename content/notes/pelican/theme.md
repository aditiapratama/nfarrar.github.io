## Pure
I'm currently using [my own fork][pure-crunk.io] of the [pure-single][] theme. While messing around with this, I've hit
a couple stumbling blocks:

- *Some* [Font Awesome][font-awesome] icons won't load in chrome. I'm not sure why (yet). I started an issue on it
  [here][FontAwesome Rendering on Chrome].
- Page's aren't displayed on the main page, even though (from looking at the templates) it appears that they should.
- The templates for tags & categories are not complete.
