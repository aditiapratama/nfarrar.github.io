## Favicon
With those pieces in place, we're actually ready to start working on the site a little bit. The first thing I wanted was
a trendy little favicon, so I snagged an image off a free image website, then starting looking around for a way to
generate the favicon using an api (cause I felt like trying to make all the things programatic).

[Real Favicon Generator][] popped up as a solution with an [API][Real Favicon Generator API].

I played around with this for awhile, but haven't gotten it quite working yet.
